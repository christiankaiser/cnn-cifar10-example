# CNN image classification example

This is a simple example of image classification using a CNN and the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

The example is implemented using Tensorflow with relatively low level functions to better understand what happens in detail.

This example is taken to a good amount from [github.com/GzuPark/image_classification](https://github.com/GzuPark/image_classification/blob/master/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb) with some minor code changes and some model architecture changes to improve the total accuracy. The final accuracy is roughly 80%, compared to about 65% for the initial model.

It must be noted that the model could of course be tweaked to get well over 90% of accuracy. See [here](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html#43494641522d3130) for the best models.
